# SenzuuBot - A Twitch Chat Bot for SenzuDuck

A bot develop for <https://www.twitch.tv/SenzuDuck>. It's really new. Lots to potentially build on.

## Technology

This is a Node.JS app with TypeScript. Why TypeScript? I likes it.

## Current Features

- Reads a JSON file to emote a random message every X minutes (interval specified in the JSON)
- There's a command parser but it doesn't really do anything right now outside of debugging stuffs so it's disabled
- That's... pretty much it
